Machine Learning deduplication pipeline 

This is what I developed during my 4 month Co-op placement with the Public Service Commission of Canada (PSC) during the summer of 2022. Note that in my eyes, there are a lot of improvements that could be made here and I do not feel confident that this system would serve as a standalone system. It also is currently configured to work specifically with a dataset internal to the PSC and would likely require a good bit of hyperparameter fine-tuning to perform well on a different data-source.
